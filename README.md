## Introduction
Hangman is a words guessing game for one player. The computer guesses a word and the user has to suggest letters one by one. Every time the word contains a letter, the computer opens it (all of them, if there are a few). 

## Description(Rules)
Hangman is a simple word guessing game. Players try to solve an unknown word by guessing the letters. If too many letters are guessed that are not in the word, the player is hanged (and loses).

The game starts with a painted gallows and begins to underline for each letter in an unknown word. When the letters are guessed, they begin to appear above the underscore. If a letter is guessed in a word that is not in the word, an image of a man on the gallows is drawn â€“ one detail for each incorrectly guessed letter. Most often, a person is drawn from 6 parts (to guess 6 letters) in the following order: head, torso, left leg, right leg, left arm, right forearm.
